# Gift Card App

This app is a simple React application that allows users to spend a gift card. 

## Getting Started 

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies. 

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/username/gift-card-app.git 
cd gift-card-app 
npm install 
``` 
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the app with: 
```bash 
npm start 
```  

 ## Functionality  

 The app displays a customer's name and a text field that displays the gift card's instructions. There is also a button that allows users to spend their gift card. When the button is clicked, the text field will update to show that the coupon has been used and the instructions will change to prompt users to visit our restaurant to renew their gift card. The button will no longer be visible after it has been clicked.
